  abstract  = {Analyzing the unstructured textual data contained in electronic health records (EHRs) has always been a challenging task. Word embedding methods have become an essential foundation for neural network-based approaches in natural language processing (NLP), to learn dense and low-dimensional word representations from large unlabeled corpora that capture the implicit semantics of words. Models like Word2Vec, GloVe or FastText have been broadly applied and reviewed in the bioinformatics and healthcare fields, most often to embed clinical notes or activity and diagnostic codes. Visualization of the learned embeddings has been used in a subset of these works, whether for exploratory or evaluation purposes. However, visualization practices tend to be heterogeneous, and lack overall guidelines.},

  abstract="Electronic health records (EHRs) involve heterogeneous data types such as binary, numeric and categorical attributes. As traditional clustering approaches require the definition of a single proximity measure, different data types are typically transformed into a common format or amalgamated through a single distance function. Unfortunately, this early transformation step largely pre-determines the cluster analysis results and can cause information loss, as the relative importance of different attributes is not considered. This exploratory work aims to avoid this premature integration of attribute types prior to cluster analysis through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called MVMC. This approach allows multiple data types to be integrated into the clustering process, explore trade-offs between them, and determine consensus clusters that are supported across these data views. We evaluate our approach in a case study focusing on systemic sclerosis (SSc), a highly heterogeneous auto-immune disease that can be considered a representative example of an EHRs data problem. Our results highlight the potential benefits of multi-view learning in an EHR context. Furthermore, this comprehensive classification integrating multiple and various data sources will help to understand better disease complications and treatment goals.",

	abstract = {Computational pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies into diagnostic workflows. It offers unprecedented opportunities for improved efficiency in treatment decisions by allowing pathologists to achieve higher precision and objectivity in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First, we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in the literature. This paves the way for the development of a foundation model for histopathology.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of Owkin, Inc., New York, NY, USA.Funding StatementThis work was granted access to the HPC resources of IDRIS under the allocations 2022-AD011012519 and 2023-AD011012519R1 made by GENCI.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
