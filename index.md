Hi there, I'm Alexandre. I'm a data scientist working at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com), an emerging biotech company with the ambition to find the right treatment for every patient. I am part of the Medical Imaging group, which focuses on the analysis and representation of histopathology data. I am mostly working within R&D on self-supervised learning to better represent digital pathology data. I am one of the main contributor behind [Phikon](https://huggingface.co/owkin/phikon), [Phikon-v2](https://huggingface.co/owkin/phikon-v2), [H0-Mini](https://huggingface.co/owkin/H0-mini) and other internal models. As such, my missions also involve improving our histology-based, AI-driven [diagnostics tools](https://www.owkin.com/diagnostics-approach). I have also a solide background in statistics applied to medical research through collaborations with industry and academics.
