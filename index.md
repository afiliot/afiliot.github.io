I am currently working as a data scientist at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com). Owkin is an emerging biotech company with the ambition to find the right treatment for every patient. I am part of the Medical Imaging group, focusing on the analysis and representation of histopatholgy data. My missions involve improving our histology-based, AI-driven [diagnostics tools](https://www.owkin.com/diagnostics-approach) such as [RlapsRisk BC](https://www.owkin.com/rlapsrisk-bc); which can be done through complex model understanding and data representation. As such, I have been working within R&D on self-supervised learning to better represent digital pathology data, that ultimately fuel all our pathology AI solutions and empower pathologists and researchers with increasingly accurate AI assistants for the benefits of patients.
