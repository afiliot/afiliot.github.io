## Work experience

### **Data scientist, Dec. 2021, now - Lille University Hospital | Lille University | INSERM**

Statistical learning and image analysis applied to clinical research as part of the INFINITE U1286 team (Institute for Translational Research in Inflammation, website [here](http://lille-inflammation-research.org/fr/))

_Research and development_
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to esogastric cancers (molecular subtyping, outcome prediction, etc.)
- Immunofluoresence imaging: weekly supervised learning and cluster analysis applied to IIF images on HEp2-cells for autoimmune diseases (patterns recognition, auto-antibodies classification, etc.)

_Project management_
- Internships supervising

### **Data scientist, Nov. 2019, Nov. 2021 - Lille University Hospital**
Statistical-learning-based clinical research projects as part of the INCLUDE team (INtegration Center of the Lille University hospital for Data Exploration, GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/include-project))

_Research and development_
- Statistical support for clinical research projects (biostatistics, machine learning): data mining and protocol design, implementation, results sharing and feedbacks with clinicians, publication if relevant
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to gastric cancers (molecular subtypes, survival estimation, etc.)
- Federated learning: POCs on the applicability of federated learning to medical research in close collaboration with the Inria Magnet team, IT engineers, DPOs, etc. Winner of the 2021 [call](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/bac-sable-donnees-personnelles-la-cnil-accompagne-12-projets-dans-le-domaine-de-la-sante-numerique) for proposals _Bac-Ã -sable CNIL_
