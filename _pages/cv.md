## Work experience

### Senior data scientist @OWKIN, Sep. 2022 - now

I am part of the Medical Imaging group which focuses on the analysis and representation of histopathology data. I work within R&D on self-supervised learning to better represent digital pathology images, leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and ML techniques to fuel all our internal research projects and pathology AI solutions. I am one of the main contributor behind  Phikon, Phikon-v2, H0-Mini and other internal models. More specically, I am also involved in the development and continuous improvement of our histology-based, AI-guided [diagnostics tools](https://www.owkin.com/diagnostics-approach) such as [RlapsRisk BC](https://www.owkin.com/rlapsrisk-bc) (lately [MSIntuit CRC](https://www.owkin.com/msintuit-crc)). Also, 
### Data scientist, Nov. 2019, Aug. 2022 - Lille University Hospital | INSERM | INRIA

#### Data scientist @ENDOMIC, Dec. 2021 - Aug. 2022

Statistical learning and image analysis applied to clinical research as part of the [ENDOMIC](https://endomic.github.io) team (INSERM, INRIA, Lille University). Working on 
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to esogastric cancers (molecular subtyping, outcome prediction, etc.)
- Immunofluoresence imaging: weekly supervised learning and cluster analysis applied to IIF images on HEp2-cells for autoimmune diseases (patterns recognition, auto-antibodies classification, etc.)

#### Data scientist @INCLUDE, Nov. 2019 - Nov. 2021 
Statistical-learning-based clinical research projects as part of the [INCLUDE](https://include-project.chru-lille.fr/en/1758-2/) team (INtegration Center of the Lille University hospital for Data Exploration). I provided statistical support for clinical research projects (biostatistics, machine learning), covering data mining and protocol design, implementation, results sharing and feedbacks with clinicians, publication if relevant. Also working on long-term projects: 
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to esogastric cancers (molecular subtyping, outcome prediction, etc.)
- Federated learning: POCs on the applicability of federated learning to medical research in close collaboration with the Inria Magnet team, IT engineers, DPOs, etc. Winner of the 2021 [call](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/bac-sable-donnees-personnelles-la-cnil-accompagne-12-projets-dans-le-domaine-de-la-sante-numerique) for proposals _Bac-Ã -sable CNIL_.

#### Research intern @Guerbet, Jun. 2019 - Nov. 2019
- *GANs*: virtual contrast enhancement applied on brain MRIs using deep generative networks.
- *3DCNN*: gliomas segmentation on Brats data set using 3D convolution networks.

#### Data scientist intern @Banque de France, Jun. 2018 - Sep. 2018
- *Credit scoring*: statistical modelling and 3 year-prediction of the European Fractional Default Risk.
- *Natural Language Processing*: analysis of companies' financial reports to evaluate the semantic risk of credit default.
