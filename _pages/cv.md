## Work experience
### Data scientist, Sep. 2022, now - Owkin

I'm part of the the Medical Imaging group. I'm focusing on the analysis and representation of digital histopathology images. I am working on the development and improvement of diagnostic tools, such as [RlapsRisk BC](https://www.owkin.com/rlapsrisk-bc). Also, I work within R&D on self-supervised learning to better represent digital pathology images, leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision and ML techniques to fuel all our internal research projects and pathology AI solutions.

### Data scientist, Nov. 2019, Aug. 2022 - Lille University Hospital | Lille University | INSERM

#### Data scientist @Lille University, Dec. 2021 - Aug. 2022

Statistical learning and image analysis applied to clinical research as part of the INFINITE U1286 team (Institute for Translational Research in Inflammation, website [here](http://lille-inflammation-research.org/fr/)). Working on 
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to esogastric cancers (molecular subtyping, outcome prediction, etc.)
- Immunofluoresence imaging: weekly supervised learning and cluster analysis applied to IIF images on HEp2-cells for autoimmune diseases (patterns recognition, auto-antibodies classification, etc.)

#### Data scientist @Lille University Hospital, Nov. 2019 - Nov. 2021 
Statistical-learning-based clinical research projects as part of the INCLUDE team (INtegration Center of the Lille University hospital for Data Exploration, GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/include-project)). I provided statistical support for clinical research projects (biostatistics, machine learning), covering data mining and protocol design, implementation, results sharing and feedbacks with clinicians, publication if relevant. Also working on long-term projects: 
- Digital histopathology: whole slide image analysis using deep learning techniques applied to esogastric cancers (molecular subtyping, outcome prediction, etc.)
- Federated learning: POCs on the applicability of federated learning to medical research in close collaboration with the Inria Magnet team, IT engineers, DPOs, etc. Winner of the 2021 [call](https://www.cnil.fr/fr/bac-sable-donnees-personnelles-la-cnil-accompagne-12-projets-dans-le-domaine-de-la-sante-numerique) for proposals _Bac-Ã -sable CNIL_.

#### Research intern @Guerbet, Jun. 2019 - Nov. 2019
- *GANs*: virtual contrast enhancement applied on brain MRIs using deep generative networks.
- *3DCNN*: gliomas segmentation on Brats data set using 3D convolution networks.

#### Data scientist intern @Banque de France, Jun. 2018 - Sep. 2018
- *Credit scoring*: statistical modelling and 3 year-prediction of the European Fractional Default Risk.
- *Natural Language Processing*: analysis of companies' financial reports to evaluate the semantic risk of credit default.
