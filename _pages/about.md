I am currently working as a data scientist in the [Infinite](http://lille-inflammation-research.org/en/) team. Infinite is a translational research unit (CHU de Lille, Lille University, Inserm) dedicated to inflammation and the understanding of its mechanisms, so that to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. 

I received my engineering degrees from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/programs/ingenieur/3a/dssl/) and [Centrale Marseille](https://www.centrale-marseille.fr/en) engineering schools in 2019. I completed the MVA MSc (Mathematics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning) from [ENS Paris-Saclay](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/) in 2019.

After graduading, I spent two years in the [Include](https://include-project.chru-lille.fr/home-project/#presentationEN) team, the CHU's data wharehouse created in 2018 and authorized by the CNIL to reuse patients' data for clinical and methodological research. I worked on a broad range of subjects, from traditional (bio)statistics and machine learning techniques (_e.g._ clustering, survival analysis, time series analysis) to more advanced and specialized topics such as decentralized machine learning or whole slide imaging.

As part of the Infinite team, I'm still working on computational pathology applied to esogastric adenocarcinoma (with Dr. Florence Renaud, pathologist at [CHU de Lille](https://twitter.com/vsobanski/status/1270043215308169216)). I also work on the analysis of immunofluorescence images through a project on auto-immunity with the CHU de Lille immunology institute (Pr. Sylvain Dubucquoi, Pr. Vincent Sobanski).
