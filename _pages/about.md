## Cumputer vision @Owkin
I am currently working as a data scientist at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com). Owkin is an emerging biotech company with the mission to find the right treatment for every patient. At Owkin, we are leveraging cutting-edge machine learning to deliver better drugs and diagnostics at scale. We use causal, multi-modal AI to enhance personalized medicine, while preserving data confidentiality through federated learning. I am part of the Medical Imaging group, focusing on the analysis and representation of histopathology data. More specically, my missions involve improving our histology-based, AI-driven [diagnostics tools](https://www.owkin.com/diagnostics-approach) such as [RlapsRisk BC](https://www.owkin.com/rlapsrisk-bc); which can be done through complex model understanding and data representation. Among others, I have been working within R&D on self-supervised learning to better represent digital pathology data, that ultimately fuel all our pathology AI solutions and empower pathologists and researchers with increasingly accurate AI assistants for the benefits of patients.

## Past experience in medical image analysis
After graduading, I spent two years in the [Include](https://include-project.chru-lille.fr/home-project/#presentationEN) team, the Lille CHU's data wharehouse created in 2018 and authorized by the CNIL to reuse patients' data for clinical and methodological research. I worked on a broad range of subjects, from traditional (bio)statistics and machine learning techniques (_e.g._ clustering, survival analysis, time series analysis) to more advanced and specialized topics such as decentralized machine learning or whole slide imaging. Then, I joined the [Infinite](http://lille-inflammation-research.org/en/) team as a data scientist. Infinite is a translational research unit (CHU de Lille, Lille University, Inserm) dedicated to inflammation and the understanding of its mechanisms, so that to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. As part of the Infinite team, I worked on computational pathology applied to esogastric adenocarcinoma (with Dr. Florence Renaud, pathologist at [CHU de Lille](https://twitter.com/vsobanski/status/1270043215308169216)). I also worked on the analysis of immunofluorescence images through a project on auto-immunity with the CHU de Lille immunology institute (Pr. Sylvain Dubucquoi, Pr. Vincent Sobanski).
