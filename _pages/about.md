## Computer vision @Owkin
I am currently working as a data scientist at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com). Owkin is an emerging biotech company with the mission to find the right treatment for every patient. At Owkin, we are leveraging cutting-edge machine learning to deliver better drugs and diagnostics. I am part of the Medical Imaging group which focuses on the analysis and representation of histopathology data. More specically, I am involved in the development and continuous improvement of our histology-based, AI-guided [diagnostics tools](https://www.owkin.com/diagnostics-approach) such as [RlapsRisk BC](https://www.owkin.com/rlapsrisk-bc) (lately [MSIntuit CRC](https://www.owkin.com/msintuit-crc)); which can be done through complex model understanding and data representation. As such, I have been working within R&D on [self-supervised learning](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/owkin_github-owkinhistosslscaling-code-associated-activity-7108373043302789120-EB3S/?trk=public_profile_like_view) and released [Phikon](https://huggingface.co/owkin/phikon), Owkin's foundation model for histology images.

## Past experience in computer vision and medical research
After graduading, I spent two years in the [Include](https://include-project.chru-lille.fr/home-project/#presentationEN) team, the data wharehouse of Lille University Hospital (France) created in 2018 and authorized by the CNIL to reuse patients' data for clinical and methodological research. I gained expertise in (bio)statistics and machine learning techniques (_e.g._ clustering, survival analysis, time series analysis) through diverse collaborations with researchers and phyicians. In the mean time, I started to specialize in computational pathology through a 2-year collaboration with Dr. Florence Renaud, [pathologist](https://twitter.com/vsobanski/status/1270043215308169216), on the prediction of molecular subtypes in esogastric adenocarcinomas. Then, I joined the [ENDOMIC](https://endomic.github.io) (Inserm | INRIA) team as a data scientist. Here, I continued working on computational pathology but also on the analysis of immunofluorescence images through a 1-year collaboration with the immunology institute of Lille University Hospital (Pr. Sylvain Dubucquoi, Pr. Vincent Sobanski).
